# Summer-Internship 2021
Guided project to design and fabricate low-cost and open source data-logger for marine estuaries.
I have worked on developing a low-cost multipurpose datalogger with easily available sensors and electronics. Due to cheap cost, the monitoring instrument can be deployed in huge numbers. Hence increasing the spatial distribution in the data.
